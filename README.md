Tool for changing cisco configs ( Java/JavaFX )

This simple tool is created to help changing cisco XML configs in a company that has telephone system based on Cisco equipment and includes routers, switches and phones to communicate inside and between offices. 
Because sometimes it is nesessary to change many XML configs I implemented windows application to simplify this process.
